# ArduRPM
using my ArduPSU board as a RPM counter for my minilathe; so far the setup has been successful, but the code for the counter doesn't go back to zero when the lathe spindle stops (should display "0 RPM"). 
I am working on some more solid code for this..
This code is an early version; the later version currently in the counter is buried somewhere on the workshop lappie...
